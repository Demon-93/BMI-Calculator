Path to improved health
You may be diagnosed with obesity if your body mass index (BMI) is at or above 30kg/m2. You can lower your BMI by following standard weight-loss tips, such as:

Eating healthy. Choose lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reduce alcohol, sugar, processed foods, sodas, and juices. Consume fewer calories.
Exercising regularly. This includes cardio and weight-bearing exercises to build muscle and lose fat. This is effective in controlling belly fat. Belly fat increases the risk of certain health conditions. Always talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise program.
Being mindful of portion control. Donâ€™t overeat during meals and snacks.
